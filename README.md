# Single Image Depth Estimation Trained via Depth from Defocus Cues
Official implementation of "Single Image Depth Estimation Trained via Depth from Defocus Cues" ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/)).
The implementation is based on the architectures of [DeepLabV3+](https://github.com/jfzhang95/pytorch-deeplab-xception) and [Self-Attention](https://github.com/heykeetae/Self-Attention-GAN).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6
- Pytorch 0.4
- Numpy
- Scipy
- OpenCV
- Path
- tqdm
- h5py
### Gaussian PSF Layer
In order to build the Gaussian PSF layer on your own machine, run the following line
```
cd ext
python setup.py install
```
